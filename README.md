# Issues for Bowls MKE

Here is where you may report any problems you are having with the site or improvements you would like to see. Understand that this is a brand new application that is coming on line. This means that we would like to see it work error-free but then slowly introduce enhancements.

This does require creating an account on Github, sorry, so that you are able to see the corrective actions being taken and for me to request further info if needed.

Make your reports using the **Issues** tab and click the green _New issue_ button to get started.

## Issues

While using this newly developed application, you may come across bugs, error, things that don't work as expected, or have ideas about improvements. We are interested in hearing these and working on making the user experience better. To help with this, we have a place to put all of your issues. It is on a site called github, which is where I hold all of my developments. Visit this link, https://github.com/gary-dalton/bowlsmke-issues, to add an issue or see any issues that others have created. Thank you.

## Roles

The system is designed to provide only appropriate access to the data, messaging, and forms. This access is done via user roles. We have preliminarily defined the following roles:

    Root

    → Treasurer
    →→ Membership Director

    → Games Administrator
    →→ League Director
    →→Tournament Director

    →→→ Marketing Manager
    →→→ Group Event Manager

    →→ Admin
    →→→→ Member
    →→→→→ User
    →→→→→→ Guest

Root, of necessity, has full access to the system and is usually the person who maintains the code and functioning of the system. The other roles should be self-explanatory.

Not all of these roles are being used and more may be created if needed. The number of arrows roughly indicated the level of access given. Typically, this means ability to view and edit user data and build system resources.

## Conclusion

This should get you started. I will post updates on what it available in the Dashboard for fully paid members , i.e. login as member@example.com.
