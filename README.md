# Issues for Bowls MKE

Here is where you may report any problems you are having with the site or improvements you would like to see. Understand that this is a brand new application that is coming on line. This means that we would like to see it work error-free but then slowly introduce enhancements.

This does require creating an account, sorry, so that you are able to see the corrective actions being taken and for me to request further info if needed.

Make your reports using the **Issues** tab and click the green _New issue_ button to get started.
